# Premises

## About you

 - You're a social scientist who works with election studies (üá¨üáß; üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø; üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø; üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†ÅÆÛ†Å©Û†Å≤Û†Åø)
 - You have used multilevel or random intercept models for limited (binary or categorical) dependent variables 
 - You use R (üòäÛ†ÅßÛ†Å¢) or Stata (üòê)
 - You are aware of census data;
 - You are aware of Bayesian methods

## Objectives for today

 - To understand what multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) is;
 - To know when MRP works well and when it works poorly;
 - To understand how a post-stratification frame is constructed
 - To be able to estimate a model and post-stratify predictions
 - To know how to incorporate uncertainty into these predictions
 
## Materials

 - The materials for this workshop are available at [https://github.com/chrishanretty/ses_mrp_workshop](github.com/chrishanretty/ses_mrp_workshop)
 - This includes:
    * these slides
	* a post-stratification frame for Scottish Parliamentary Constituencies
	* A cut-down version of the post-2021 election Scottish Election Study data
 - This does not include:
    * post-stratification frames for any other jurisdiction

# About MRP

## Origins

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

![Ithiel de Sola Pool (b. 1917, d. 1984)](index_files/desolapool.jpg)

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

 - Early attempts by the Simulmatic Corporation to forecast US
   presidential elections (1960)
 - Fictionalized in the thriller novel *The 480* (1964)
 - Key idea: large national surveys allow inferences to be drawn about
   the behaviours of different voter blocks

## Modern treatments

 - The best modern treatment is (depending on taste)
      * Park, David K, Andrew Gelman, and Joseph Bafumi. 2004. "Bayesian Multilevel Estimation with Poststratification: State-Level Estimates from National Polls", *Political Analysis* 12 (4): 375‚Äì85.
	  * Lax, Jeffrey R, and Justin H Phillips. 2009. ‚ÄúHow Should We Estimate Public Opinion in the States?‚Äù *American Journal of Political Science* 53 (1): 107‚Äì21.
	  
## What changed? 

 - Between the 1960 and the 2000s we've seen
      * vast increases in computing power
	  * development of Bayesian modelling and multilevel modelling
 - MRP is now a mature technology, and new papers tend to focus on
   marginal improvements which deal with better modelling or better
   ways to deal with post-stratification
 - MRP remains computationally intensive (model runs of up to several hours)
 
## The multilevel element

 - In studies of electoral behaviour: survey respondents are individuals (level 1) nested in electoral districts (level 2)
 - These electoral districts have effects on the people in them (context matters)
 - In MRP models, these effects are modelled as **random intercepts**
 
## Why random intercepts?

 - Our predictions are more accurate because we've reduced variance (at the cost of bias)
 - We don't really care about the units *per se*
 - This approach also extends to demographic groups (education, age, ethnicity, sex), with a few more philosophical qualms
 - Random intercepts, but you'll also hear about *partial pooling* or *regularization*

## The regression element

 - Any regression model can be turned into a MRP model
 - There are some techniques for small area estimation which don't use
   regression but instead use tree-based models [@bisbee2019barp], but
   these (i) all use some form of regularization; and (ii) have had
   mixed success [@goplerud2023re]
 - Most MRP models are binary or categorical models
 - Continuous models (e.g., for feeling thermometers) are rare;
   ordinal or bivariate models are rarer still
 
## The post-stratification element

 - What distinguishes MRP is the idea that we use our models to
   generate predictions (for discrete types) which we then aggregate
 - Example: 5,040 voter "types" defined by
    * seven age groups, times
	* two sexes, times
	* five educational qualifications, times
	* 72 constituencies
 - This requires us to know the **joint distribution** of type-defining attributes
 
## How it's usually applied (1)

 - **Number of area level units:** between 4 (Canadian metropolitan areas) and 9,981 (US Census administrative units) with a median value of 50
 - **Sample size:** Median sample size of ~7,500, IQR of ~2,500 to ~55,000
 - **Sample size/areas**: median ratio of 87 respondents/unit


**Source:** @lobo2021how


## How it's usually applied (2): individual predictors

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Almost always included:

 - **Gender:** 92%
 - **Education:** 89%
 - **Age:** 86%
 - **Ethnicity:** 70%

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Sometimes included:

 - **Past vote:** 17%
 - **Social grade:** 5%

:::

::::


## How it's usually applied (3): Area-level predictors


 - **Median number of area-level predictors** is three (IQR: 2 to 5)
 - ... but this depends heavily on the number of areas included
 - There is a tension between adding relevant data and over-fitting 
 - ... but we should probably be using more area level predictors

## "What works"

 - Post-stratification variables include variables that affect survey
   participation (for non-probability samples)
 - Modelling includes a large number (up to one for every ten areas)
   of relevant area level variables [@hanretty2018comparing]
 - Modelled behaviour/opinion strongly connected with individual level
   characteristics (no opinions on individual MPs or context-specific
   questions)

## To what end?

 - **In its own right**. It can be valuable to know public opinion.
 - **As a predictor variable**. We may want to know the association
   between public opinion and legislator behaviour.
 - **As an outcome variable?** I struggle to think of cases where we
   would model aggregate opinion when we had individual opinion.

## {.center}

::: {.callout-note}

Let's pause here for questions before going on to post-stratification frames.
:::

# Post-stratification frames

## Post-stratification frames

 - We need to know how many voters of each different type live in each
   different area
 - This involves relying on some other more certain source of data
 - We can either rely on the Census or some other massive non-probability sample
 - In the UK, this can mean either the different national censuses, or the Annual Population Survey or Labour Force Survey (n = 320,000 per year)

## Common problems

 - Dissemination sites like [nomisweb](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/) typically give two-way or three-way Census tables, but not four- or five-way Census tables
 - We want to include individual level variables (past vote) which are not included in Census data
 - Census variables are released for subgroups (those aged 16-64) rather than the population we are interested in
 - Census variables are not released for subgroups we are interested in (those who have the vote)

## Raking to the rescue

 - Raking, or iterative proportional fitting, is a way to make joint distributions match marginal distributions
 - It involves repeatedly multiplying and dividing rows and columns in order to match their marginal distributions
 - We have to start with some initial joint distribution, which could be from our survey data

## In this case... 

 - The **joint distribution** comes from the December 2020 Labour Force Survey / Annual Population Survey micro-data (n = 26,279 in Scotland)
 - (This is available through the UK Data Archive under a non-commercial use licence)
 - We use December 2020 because only December releases contain educational data, and because it is the closest wave prior to the 2021 elections
 
## Variables included

 - We use information on the following variables:
     * Age
	 * Sex
	 * Highest qualifications
	 * Ethnicity

## Categorization

 - **Age:** eight categories (16-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75+)
 - **Sex:** two categories (male, female)
 - **Qualifications**: seven categories (No qualifications, NVQ1, NVQ2, NVQ3, NVQ4+, other quals., trade apprenticeships)
 - **Ethnicity**: two categories (white, ethnic minority)

## Marginal distributions

 - For **age** and **sex**, we use marginal distributions from National Records of Scotland
 - They provide [population estimates broken down by sex and single year of age](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/2011-based-special-area-population-estimates/spc-population-estimates) for each Scottish Parliament Constituency (SPC)
 - For **education** and **ethnicity**, we use information from the APS/LFS (March 2021 editions)
 - There is one wrinkle for **education**: the LFS is only interested in those 16-64.
 - We take 2005-vintage data for those 50-65 and bring it forward to cover those 65+

## Raking in R

 - In order to rake in R, I use the `anesrake` package
 - As the name suggests, this is made for ANES data, but works fine with other data
 - Other packages (`ipfr`, `mipfp`) are available
 
## Raking in R (2)

 - Suppose we have variables in `anes` called `agecats` and `married`
 - We want to match the following targets:
 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
married_tgt <- c(.4, ## logical false = not married 
                 .6) ## logical true = married

age_tgt <- c("age1824" = .1,
             "age2534" = .15,
             "age3544" = .17,
             "age4554" = .23,
             "age5564" = .22,
             "age6599" = .13)

tgts <- list("married" = married_tgt,
             "agecats" = age_tgt)
```

## Raking in R (3)

 - We'd have to tidy our data to make sure it matches how our targets are specified
 
```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(anesrake)
library(tidyverse)
data("anes04")
anes04 <- anes04 |>
    mutate(caseid  = seq_len(n()),
           agecats = cut(age,
                         c(0, 25,35,45,55,65,99),
                         labels = c("age1824", "age2534", "age3544",
                                    "age4554", "age5564", "age6599")))
```

## Raking in R (4)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
res <- anesrake(tgts,
                anes04,
                caseid = anes04$caseid,
                verbose = TRUE)
```


## Raking in R (5)

We'll need to get access to these weights...

```{r, echo = TRUE}
caseweights <- data.frame(caseid = res$caseid,
                          w8 = res$weightvec)

anes04 <- left_join(anes04,
                    caseweights,
                    by = "caseid")
```


## Raking a post-stratification frame

 - Raking a post-stratification frame is no different in principle
 - In practice, we're raking on more variables, and raking one constituency at a time
 - IPF is pretty robust, so we don't have to worry about problems
 - ... except where you have structural zeros

## Adding on political variables

 - I haven't said anything about political variables for post-stratification
 - I run an MRP model of list vote choice using the SES post-election wave
 - I then adjust these MRP predictions to match known results using a
   "logit shift" [@rosenman2023recalibration]
 - I add these predictions on to the post-stratification frame and adjust

## The resulting post-stratification frame

 - **Age:** eight categories (16-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75+)
 - **Sex:** two categories (male, female)
 - **Qualifications**: seven categories (No qualifications, NVQ1, NVQ2, NVQ3, NVQ4+, other quals., trade apprenticeships)
 - **Ethnicity**: two categories (white, ethnic minority)
 - **2021 list vote**: seven categories (Con., DNV, Green, Lab, LibDem, Other, SNP)

## Some summary statistics...

 - There are fewer rows (80,297) than unique combinations of the variables
 - Not all combinations are possible; some have trace presence (16-19 years old with degrees)
 - The weights are expressed as proportions of the 16+ population (i.e., VAP)
 - The average (mean) weight is 1 in 1,100
 - The maximum weight is just under 5% (white women in Edinburgh Central aged 30-39 w/ NVQ4+ who didn't vote)

## `2021_results_over_vap.csv`

A comma separated values file containing information on the list votes
of selected parties (and those who did not vote) expressed as a
proportion of the voting age population.

This is the constituency-level analogue of the "past_list_vote"
variable in the post-stratification frame.

## `ses21_postelection_subset.csv` {.smaller}

A comma separated values file with 3,442 observations on the following
variables:

 - **age**: an integer
 - **birthSex**: a character variable with two unique values
 - **profile_education_level**: a character variable with 20 unique values
 - **ethnicity_new**: a character variable with 17 unique values
 - **ethnicity_new1617**: as above, but for a small number of top-up respondents
 - **w2_voted**: whether or not the respondent voted in the 2021 SP election
 - **w2_vb15**: the party for which the respondent voted
 - **w2_uk10**: the respondent's view on Scottish independence (1 =
   'Yes'; 2 = 'No'; 3 = 'Would not vote'; 4 = 'Don't know')
   

## `psf.csv`

A comma separated values file; a post-stratification frame, as discussed above.

## R packages used

I'll be using the following packages:

 - `tidyverse`: the general utility package
 - `here`: for consistently dealing with file locations
 - `lme4`: for frequentist multilevel models
 - `brms`: for Bayesian models of all kinds
 

## Tidying the data

```{.r include="../R/001_tidy_data.R" start-line=1 end-line=13}
```

## Making categories match: age

```{.r include="../R/001_tidy_data.R" start-line=16 end-line=34}
```

## Making categories match: education

```{.r include="../R/001_tidy_data.R" start-line=53 end-line=81}
```

## Notes on tidying

 - We drop missing observations; we could use single-shot imputation with `Amelia`
 - We drop from 3,442 observations to 2,841 observations (mostly due to missingness on the outcome)
 - We make some assumptions about ethnicity and past vote behaviour at some points
    * "Don't knows" are "white" and "did not vote" respectively
 - Your thoughts on this welcome!

## What's wrong with this?

 - There's nothing wrong with this model; it does the job, and quickly
 - However, we have no measures of uncertainty, and 
 - ... adding another constituency-level predictor introduces problems of perfect separation [@zorn2005solution]
 - Both of these problems can be dealt with using Bayesian models

## Things to note

 - We can include interactions, but it's best to include them manually
 - Memory requirements can become more demanding with more complicated post-stratification frames
 - I haven't addressed categorical outcomes
 - This code will work for any dichotomous or continuous outcome (or
   any outcome that can be treated as such)
